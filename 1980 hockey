<center><h3> Miracle on Ice </center></h3>
   <center>
<p class = "thin-black-border black-text">The "Miracle on Ice" refers to a medal-round game during the men's ice hockey tournament at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, played between the hosting United States, and the four-time defending gold medalists, the Soviet Union.
<br><br>
The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more in Lake Placid.
<br></br> 
For the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2–2, and the Soviets leading 3–2 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead during the third and final period, winning the game 4–3 in a major upset against the Cold War rival. Following the game, the U.S. went on to clinch the gold medal by beating Finland in their final match of the tournament. Likewise, the Soviet Union took the silver medal by beating Sweden.

<h5>Fun Facts!</h5>
<ul>
 <li>The United States' team—led by head coach Herb Brooks—consisted exclusively of amateur players, and was the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history.</li>
  <br></br>
  <li>The Soviet Union entered the Lake Placid games as the heavy favorite, having won the previous four ice hockey gold medals dating back to the 1964 games. </li>
  <br></br>
 <li>In the four Olympics following their 1960 bronze medal finish at Squaw Valley, Soviet teams had gone 27–1–1 (wins-losses-ties) and outscored their opponents 175–44.</li>
  <br></br>
  <li>Herb Brooks was a member of the 1960 Olympic team, only to become the last cut the week before the Games started. Three weeks later, Brooks sat at home with his father and watched the team he almost made win gold. </li>
  <br></br>
  <li>Brooks' original expressions were known by his players as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Brooks#Brooksisms">"Brooksisms"</a></li>
